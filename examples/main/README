This directory contains all the examples from the main paper.
Since Encore is an object oriented language, we provide versions
that are written in a style more suitable for Encore. The
examples are:

* Treiber Stack (Stack.enc)

* Michael-Scott Queue (Queue.enc)

* Tim Harris' List (List.enc)

The Makefile can build all the examples (make all) as well as run
them (make run).
